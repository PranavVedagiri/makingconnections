# Making Connections Alumni Network

The UW Womenâ€™s Center Making Connections program serves Seattle area high school students with tutoring, mentorship and college preparation. There are hundreds of alumni, the majority of whom are first-generation college women pursuing careers in STEM fields. Although alumni want to network with each other, Making Connections does not have an efficient system to do this. Our web application provides users with a detailed alumni directory and community platform that allow users to network and share resources about job & internship opportunities, scholarships and more. Facilitating alumni networking will help students access resources & feel like part of the Making Connections community.

## Technology Decisions

### Stack
The stack that we chose consisted of the regular wordpress stack which includes PHP, HTML, and CSS. The reason why we chose this stack is due to the fact that we wanted to make it easier for the stakeholders to continue to make changes to the website many years after we passed the website over to them. We wanted to ensure that the staff of Making Connections required very little technological aptitude in order to continue to update the website and keep it running.
